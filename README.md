# Project Overview

In this project, we'll anticipate the upcoming temperature utilizing authentic information. We'll begin by downloading a dataset of nearby climate. You can alter this to your own area. Then, at that point, we'll clean the information and prepare it for AI. We'll construct a framework to make verifiable forecasts. Then, we'll add more indicators to work on the model. We'll end with how to make following day expectations.
